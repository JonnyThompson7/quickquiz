# Submission for Module 4 Challenge - Web APIs Code Quiz

In this project you will be taken to a site allowing you view scores or take a timed quiz with 5 questions all themed around JavaScript. If you choose to take the quiz the 90 second timer will begin and you have to answer the questions, but time is taken off for each wrong answer and if the timer hits 0, your run is over. Once all 5 questions have been answered, you are prompted with your score and the ability to add your name and score to scoreboard. After posting your score, you will be able to view all scores, clear all scores, or go back to the start where you can either view all scores again, or take the quiz!
